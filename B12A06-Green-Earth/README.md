#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

- `var` is function-scoped and allows re-declaration. It’s the older way of declaring variables.
- `let` is block-scoped and can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.
- const is also block-scoped but cannot be reassigned. It’s used for fixed values.
- Use `let` when the value might change, and `const` when it should stay constant.


#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

- `forEach()` runs a function on each item but doesn’t return anything.
- `map()` returns a new array with modified items.
- `filter()` returns a new array with items that pass a condition.
- Use `map()` to transform data, `filter()` to remove unwanted items, and `forEach()` for side effects like logging.



#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?


- Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions using `=>`.
- They don’t have their own `this`, which makes them useful in callbacks.
- Example:~  const add = (a, b) => a + b;
